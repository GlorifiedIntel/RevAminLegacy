                    men, from seemingly inconsequential backgrounds, but whose births are destined to alter 
                    the course of history. Often from such relative obscurity, men of purpose are humbly 
                    raised, who will blaze new trajectories, shining their torches in life’s darkest and 
                    crude places, and birthing new hopes. </p>

            <h3>Birth</h3>
            <p class="card-text zaigi">Rev., Prof. Amin Zaigi Ngharen was a pastor, speaker, 
                and best-selling author of “The begging Church.”  And “Give me this Mountain”. 
                He served the people in Kings’ Summit a Congress WBN Kingdom Community in Akwanga, 
                Nasarawa, Nigeria. His message for the hurting, the guilty, the lonely, and 
                the discouraged is “God loves you.”</p>
            
            <p class="card-text zaigi">As a writer, Amin was known for combining historic, poetic 
                storytelling and adrenalin power packed messages with the heart of a pastor, lecturer 
                and historian. All of his best books began as sermon series at Hinterland then, and Kings’ 
                Summit. </p>

            <p class="card-text zaigi">Amin’s books “The begging Church” and “Give me this mountain” had 
                motivated lots of people and created in them the passion to win soul for the Kingdom of 
                God on heart. </p>
            <p class="card-text zaigi">Monday, 23rd August, 1965, was an ordinary day. 
                Just like any other, a shrilling sound of a newborn’s cry was heard. The baby 
                born into the loving family of Princess Habiba and her beloved husband, Pa Zaigi 
                fondly called "Zaki". Amin was the fourth of twelve children, of his parents, 
                late Pa Zaigi and Princess Habiba Ngharen Zaigi, of Rija, Mada Central 
                District of Akwanga Local Government Area in Nasarawa State. This son would live 
                to survive many things that cut short the lives of others. And in due time, this 
                son would emerge as a Professor of History, amongst many other accomplishments.</p>
